# missile-defense
A small game made in javascript utilizing the P5js library. The game is a clone of the old missile defense games where a meteor or rocket would falls from the top of the screen onto buildings or structures at the bottom of the screen. 

I think the structure of this project is pretty poor, but I do plan on going back and using this project to learn more about clean code techniques.
