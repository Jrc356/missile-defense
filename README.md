# Missile Defense
A small game made in javascript utilizing the P5js library. The game is a clone of the old missile defense games where meteors would fall from the top of the screen onto buildings or structures at the bottom of the screen. The objective of the game is to keep your buildings alive by shooting the meteors down with your gun.

# Setup
This is an in browser game so just clone the repo and open index.html in your browser of choice (tested on firefox so let me know if something silly happens elsewhere)

# Controls
Use the left and right arrow keys to turn the gun. Use the space bar to fire a bullet. Simple as that!

# To Do
- Add menus
- Add pause
- improve building placement on bigger screens
- Add images/gifs
- Add Ai player
- Go against the ai?
